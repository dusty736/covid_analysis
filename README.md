## Statement of Purpose
Coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, has changed life for everyone in 2020.  As a masters student studying Data Science at UBC, the goal of this project is leverage the skills that I have learned to investigate the following questions:

### Inferential Questions

  a.) What geographical, socioeconomic, health, and race factors can impact a regions Covid morality rate?
  
  b.) Did the actions that states and local juristictions slow the spread of Covid?
  
### Prediction Questions

  a.) Build a categorical classifier model that can generate a probability of mortality for an individual based on pre-existing conditions, age, race, etc..  The purpose of this prediction analysis is not to be used as triage, but more for analysis of regional and hospital resources.
  
  b.) Build a time series model to predict regional case rate per 100k.
 
## The Data
This analysis will be restricted to the United States, and focus specifically on the county level for geographical data.  Only publicly available data will be used.
